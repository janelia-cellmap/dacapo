    def register_hierarchy(self, cls, cls_fn):
        """
        Register a class hierarchy for typed structure/unstructure
        conversion.

        For each class in the hierarchy under (including) ``cls``, this will
        store an additional ``__type__`` attribute (a string) in the object
        dictionary. This ``__type__`` string will be the concrete class of the
        object, and will be used to structure the dictionary back into an
        object of the correct class.

        For this to work, this function needs to know how to convert a
        ``__type__`` string back into a class, for which it used the provided
        ``cls_fn``.

        Args:
            cls (class):

                    The top-level class of the hierarchy to register.
            cls_fn (function):

                    A function mapping type strings to classes. This can be as
                    simple as ``lambda typ: eval(typ)``, if all subclasses of
                    ``cls`` are visible to the module that calls this method.
        Raises:
            TypeError: If ``cls`` is not a class.
        Example:

            If class ``A`` is the base of class ``B``, and
            ``converter.register_hierarchy(A, lambda typ: eval(typ))`` has been
            called, the dictionary ``y = converter.unstructure(x)`` will
            contain a ``__type__`` field that is ``'A'`` if ``x = A()`` and
            ``B`` if ``x = B()``.

            This ``__type__`` field is then used by ``x =
            converter.structure(y, A)`` to recreate the concrete type of ``x``.
        Note:

                ``__type__`` string will be the concrete class of the object, and
