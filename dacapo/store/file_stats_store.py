class FileStatsStore(StatsStore):
    """A File based store for run statistics. Used to store and retrieve training statistics and validation scores.

    The store is organized as follows:
    - A directory for training statistics, with a subdirectory for each run. Each run directory contains a pickled list of TrainingIterationStats objects.
    - A directory for validation scores, with a subdirectory for each run. Each run directory contains a pickled list of ValidationIterationScores objects.

    Attributes:
    - path: The root directory for the store.
    - training_stats: The directory for training statistics.
    - validation_scores: The directory for validation scores.

    Methods:
    - store_training_stats(run_name, stats): Store the training statistics for a run.
    - retrieve_training_stats(run_name): Retrieve the training statistics for a run.
    - store_validation_iteration_scores(run_name, scores): Store the validation scores for a run.
    - retrieve_validation_iteration_scores(run_name): Retrieve the validation scores for a run.
    - delete_training_stats(run_name): Delete the training statistics for a run.

    Note: The store does not support concurrent access. It is intended for use in single-threaded applications.
