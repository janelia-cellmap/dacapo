    Node to reject batches based on the mask's filled vs empty ratio.

    Args:
        gt (ArrayKey, optional): The ground truth array key that will be used.
            Default is None.
        p (float, optional): The probability threshold for rejecting batches until
            a non-empty ground truth is found. Default is 0.5.
        background (int, optional): The value representing the background in
            the ground truth data. Default is 0.

    This class inherits from :class: `BatchFilter`.

    In the setup() method, it asserts that only one provider is in the upstream.
    In the provide() method, it makes sure that the gt ArrayKey is in the request
    provided. It then keeps requesting batches from the upstream until it finds
    a batch where the ground truth is not empty, or the random number generated
    is greater than the threshold p.
