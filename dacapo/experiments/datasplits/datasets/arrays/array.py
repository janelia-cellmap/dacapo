class Array(ABC):
    """
    An Array is a multi-dimensional array of data that can be read from and written to. It is
    defined by a region of interest (ROI) in world units, a voxel size, and a number of spatial
    dimensions. The data is stored in a numpy array, and can be accessed using numpy-like slicing
    syntax.

    The Array class is an abstract base class that defines the interface for all Array
    implementations. It provides a number of properties that must be implemented by subclasses,
    such as the ROI, voxel size, and data type of the array. It also provides a method for fetching
    data from the array, which is implemented by slicing the numpy array.

    The Array class also provides a method for checking if the array can be visualized in
    Neuroglancer, and a method for generating a Neuroglancer layer for the array. These methods are
    implemented by subclasses that support visualization in Neuroglancer.

    Attributes:
        attrs (Dict[str, Any]): A dictionary of metadata attributes stored on this array.
        axes (List[str]): The axes of this dataset as a string of characters, as they are indexed.
            Permitted characters are:
                * ``zyx`` for spatial dimensions
                * ``c`` for channels
                * ``s`` for samples
        dims (int): The number of spatial dimensions.
        voxel_size (Coordinate): The size of a voxel in physical units.
        roi (Roi): The total ROI of this array, in world units.
        dtype (Any): The dtype of this array, in numpy dtypes
        num_channels (Optional[int]): The number of channels provided by this dataset. Should return
            None if the channel dimension doesn't exist.
        data (np.ndarray): A numpy-like readable and writable view into this array.
        writable (bool): Can we write to this Array?
    Methods:
        __getitem__(self, roi: Roi) -> np.ndarray: Get a numpy like readable and writable view into
            this array.
        _can_neuroglance(self) -> bool: Check if this array can be visualized in Neuroglancer.
        _neuroglancer_layer(self): Generate a Neuroglancer layer for this array.
        _slices(self, roi: Roi) -> Iterable[slice]: Generate a list of slices for the given ROI.
    Note:
        This class is used to define the interface for all Array implementations. It provides a
        number of properties that must be implemented by subclasses, such as the ROI, voxel size, and
        data type of the array. It also provides a method for fetching data from the array, which is

        layer for the array. These methods are implemented by subclasses that support visualization
        in Neuroglancer.
