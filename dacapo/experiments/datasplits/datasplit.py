class DataSplit(ABC):
    """
    A class for creating a simple train dataset and no validation dataset. It is derived from `DataSplit` class.
    It is used to split the data into training and validation datasets. The training and validation datasets are
    used to train and validate the model respectively.

    Attributes:
        train : list
            The list containing training datasets. In this class, it contains only one dataset for training.
        validate : list
            The list containing validation datasets. In this class, it is an empty list as no validation dataset is set.
    Methods:
        __init__(self, datasplit_config):
            The constructor for DummyDataSplit class. It initialises a list with training datasets according to the input configuration.
    Notes:
        This class is used to split the data into training and validation datasets.

        A method to visualize the data in Neuroglancer. It creates a Neuroglancer viewer and adds the layers of the training and validation datasets to it.

        Args:
            embedded : bool
                A boolean flag to indicate if the Neuroglancer viewer is to be embedded in the notebook.
        Returns:
            viewer : obj
                The Neuroglancer viewer object.
        Raises:
            Exception
                If the model setup cannot be loaded, an Exception is thrown which is logged and handled by training the model without head matching.
        Examples:
            >>> viewer = datasplit._neuroglancer(embedded=True)
        Notes:
            This function is called by the DataSplit class to visualize the data in Neuroglancer.
            It creates a Neuroglancer viewer and adds the layers of the training and validation datasets to it.
            Neuroglancer is a powerful tool for visualizing large-scale volumetric data.
