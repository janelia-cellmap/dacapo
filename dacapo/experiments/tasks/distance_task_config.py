class DistanceTaskConfig(TaskConfig):
    """This is a Distance task config used for generating and
    evaluating signed distance transforms as a way of generating
    segmentations.

    The advantage of generating distance transforms over regular
    affinities is you can get a denser signal, i.e. 1 misclassified
    pixel in an affinity prediction could merge 2 otherwise very
    distinct objects, this cannot happen with distances.

    Attributes:
        channels: A list of channel names.
        clip_distance: Maximum distance to consider for false positive/negatives.
        tol_distance: Tolerance distance for counting false positives/negatives
        scale_factor: The amount by which to scale distances before applying a tanh normalization.
        mask_distances: Whether or not to mask out regions where the true distance to
                       object boundary cannot be known. This is anywhere that the distance to crop boundary
                       is less than the distance to object boundary.
        clipmin: The minimum value for distance weights.
        clipmax: The maximum value for distance weights.
    Methods:
        verify(self) -> Tuple[bool, str]: This method verifies the DistanceTaskConfig object.
    Notes:
        This is a subclass of TaskConfig.
