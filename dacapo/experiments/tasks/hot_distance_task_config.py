class HotDistanceTaskConfig(TaskConfig):
    """
    Class for generating TaskConfigs for the HotDistanceTask, which predicts one hot encodings of classes, as well as signed distance transforms of those classes.

    Attributes:
        task_type: A reference to the Hot Distance Task class.
        channels (List[str]): A list of channel names.
        clip_distance (float): Maximum distance to consider for false positive/negatives.
        tol_distance (float): Tolerance distance for counting false positives/negatives.
        scale_factor (float): The amount by which to scale distances before applying
                              a tanh normalization. Defaults to 1.
        mask_distances (bool): Whether or not to mask out regions where the true distance to
                               object boundary cannot be known. Defaults to False
    Methods:
        verify(self) -> Tuple[bool, str]: This method verifies the HotDistanceTaskConfig object.
    Note:
        Generating distance transforms over regular affinities provides you with a denser
        signal, i.e., one misclassified pixel in an affinity prediction can merge 2
        otherwise very distinct objects, a situation that cannot happen with distances.
