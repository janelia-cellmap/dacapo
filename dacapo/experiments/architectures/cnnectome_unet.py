    shaped like::

        ``(batch=1, channels, [length,] depth, height, width)``.

    This U-Net performs only "valid" convolutions, i.e., sizes of the feature
    maps decrease after each convolution. It will perfrom 4D convolutions as
    long as ``length`` is greater than 1. As soon as ``length`` is 1 due to a

                The number of input channels.
            fmaps_out:

        The U-Net expects 3D or 4D tensors shaped like::

            ``(batch=1, channels, [length,] depth, height, width)``.

        This U-Net performs only "valid" convolutions, i.e., sizes of the
        feature maps decrease after each convolution. It will perfrom 4D
        convolutions as long as ``length`` is greater than 1. As soon as
        ``length`` is 1 due to a valid convolution, the time dimension will be
        dropped and tensors with ``(b, c, z, y, x)`` will be use (and returned)
        from there on.

        Args:
            in_channels:
                The number of input channels.
            num_fmaps:
                The number of feature maps in the first layer. This is also the
                number of output feature maps. Stored in the ``channels``
                dimension.
            fmap_inc_factor:
                By how much to multiply the number of feature maps between
                layers. If layer 0 has ``k`` feature maps, layer ``l`` will
                have ``k*fmap_inc_factor**l``.
            downsample_factors:
                List of tuples ``(z, y, x)`` to use to down- and up-sample the
                feature maps between layers.
            kernel_size_down (optional):
                List of lists of kernel sizes. The number of sizes in a list
                determines the number of convolutional layers in the
                corresponding level of the build on the left side. Kernel sizes
                can be given as tuples or integer. If not given, each
                convolutional pass will consist of two 3x3x3 convolutions.
            kernel_size_up (optional):
                List of lists of kernel sizes. The number of sizes in a list
                determines the number of convolutional layers in the
                corresponding level of the build on the right side. Within one
                of the lists going from left to right. Kernel sizes can be
                given as tuples or integer. If not given, each convolutional
                pass will consist of two 3x3x3 convolutions.
            activation:
                Which activation to use after a convolution. Accepts the name
                of any tensorflow activation function (e.g., ``ReLU`` for
                ``torch.nn.ReLU``).
            fov (optional):
                Initial field of view in physical units
            voxel_size (optional):
                Size of a voxel in the input data, in physical units
            num_heads (optional):
                Number of decoders. The resulting U-Net has one single encoder
                path and num_heads decoder paths. This is useful in a
                multi-task learning context.
            constant_upsample (optional):
                If set to true, perform a constant upsampling instead of a
                transposed convolution in the upsampling layers.
            padding (optional):
                How to pad convolutions. Either 'same' or 'valid' (default).
            upsample_channel_contraction:
                When performing the ConvTranspose, whether to reduce the number
                of channels by the fmap_increment_factor. can be either bool
                or list of bools to apply independently per layer.
            activation_on_upsample:
                Whether or not to add an activation after the upsample operation.
            use_attention:
                Whether or not to use an attention block in the U-Net.
            attention:
                The attention blocks.
        Returns:
            The U-Net module.

    """
    Attention Block Module:

       The AttentionBlock uses two separate pathways to process 'g' and 'x',
       combines them, and applies a sigmoid activation to generate an attention map.
       This map is then used to scale the input features 'x', resulting in an output
       that focuses on important features as dictated by the gating signal 'g'.

       The attention block takes two inputs: 'g' (gating signal) and 'x' (input features).

               [g] --> W_g --\                 /--> psi --> * --> [output]
                               \               /
               [x] --> W_x --> [+] --> relu --

       Where:
           - W_g and W_x are 1x1 Convolution followed by Batch Normalization
           - [+] indicates element-wise addition
           - relu is the Rectified Linear Unit activation function
           - psi is a sequence of 1x1 Convolution, Batch Normalization, and Sigmoid activation
           - * indicates element-wise multiplication between the output of psi and input feature 'x'
           - [output] has the same dimensions as input 'x', selectively emphasized by attention weights

       Attributes:
           dims:
               The number of dimensions of the input tensors.
           kernel_sizes:
               The kernel sizes for the convolutional layers.
           upsample_factor:
               The factor by which to upsample the attention map.
           W_g:
               The 1x1 Convolutional layer for the gating signal.
           W_x:
               The 1x1 Convolutional layer for the input features.
           psi:
               The 1x1 Convolutional layer followed by Sigmoid activation.
           up:
               The upsampling layer to match the dimensions of the input features.
           relu:
               The Rectified Linear Unit activation function.
       Methods:
           calculate_and_apply_padding(smaller_tensor, larger_tensor):
               Calculate and apply symmetric padding to the smaller tensor to match the dimensions of the larger tensor.
           forward(g, x):
               Forward pass of the Attention Block.
       Note:
           The AttentionBlockModule is an instance of the ``torch.nn.Module`` class.
