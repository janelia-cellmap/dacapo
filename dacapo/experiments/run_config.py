"""
This module structures and configures the run for the models used in the dacapo library. It helps define
the backbone architecture, the tasks it is supposed to run, the training procedures and the data it will
use. Additionally, it provides room for repetition, setting the number of iterations and defining 
validation intervals during a run.

This configuration makes model runs more structured and customizable based on user's needs. This 
configuration is twined to each independent run, allowing unique settings for different runs.

Classes:
    RunConfig: Defines and structures a run for the model using several parameters.

    A class to represent a configuration of a run that helps to structure all the tasks,
    architecture, training, and datasplit configurations.

    ...

    Attributes:
    -----------
    task_config: `TaskConfig`
        A config defining the Task to run that includes deciding the output of the model and
        different methods to achieve the goal.

    architecture_config: `ArchitectureConfig`
         A config that defines the backbone architecture of the model. It impacts the model's
         performance significantly.

    trainer_config: `TrainerConfig`
        Defines how batches are generated and passed for training the model along with defining
        configurations like batch size, learning rate, number of cpu workers and snapshot logging.

    datasplit_config: `DataSplitConfig`
        Configures the data available for the model during training or validation phases.

    name: str
        A unique name for this run to distinguish it.

    repetition: int
        The repetition number of this run.

    num_iterations: int
        The total number of iterations to train for during this run.

    validation_interval: int
        Specifies how often to perform validation during the run. It defaults to 1000.

    start_config : `Optional[StartConfig]`
        A starting point for continued training. It is optional and can be left out.
