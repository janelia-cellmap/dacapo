.. py:class:: GraphSource(key: gunpowder.GraphKey, graph: gunpowder.Graph)




   A provider for serving graph data in gunpowder pipelines.

   The Graph Source loads a single graph to serve to the pipeline based on
   ROI requests it receives.

   .. attribute:: key

      The key of the graph to be served.

      :type: gp.GraphKey

   .. attribute:: graph

      The graph to be served.

      :type: gp.Graph

   .. method:: setup()

      Set up the provider.

   .. method:: provide(request)

      Provides the graph for the requested ROI.
      

   .. note::

      This class is a subclass of gunpowder.BatchProvider and is used to
      serve graph data to gunpowder pipelines.

   .. py:method:: setup()

      Set up the provider. This function sets the provider to provide the
      graph with the given key.

      :raises RuntimeError: If the key is already provided.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> graph_source.setup()


   .. py:method:: provide(request)

      Provides the graph for the requested ROI.

      This method will be passively called by gunpowder to get a batch.
      Depending on the request we provide a subgraph of our data, or nothing
      at all.

      :param request: BatchRequest with the same ROI for
      :type request: gp.BatchRequest
      :param each requested array and graph.:

      :returns: The graph contained in a Batch.
      :rtype: outputs (gp.Batch)

      :raises KeyError: If the requested key is not in the request.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> request = gp.BatchRequest()
      >>> request[gp.GraphKey("GRAPH")] = gp.GraphSpec(roi=gp.Roi((0, 0, 0), (1, 1, 1)))
      >>> graph_source.provide(request)
