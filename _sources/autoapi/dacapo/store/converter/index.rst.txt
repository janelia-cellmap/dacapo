   A converter that stores and retrieves type information for selected
   class hierarchies. Used to reconstruct a concrete class from unstructured
   data.

   .. attribute:: hooks

      A dictionary mapping classes to lists of
      hooks that should be applied to them.

      :type: Dict[Type, List[Hook]]

   .. method:: register_hierarchy

      Register a class hierarchy for typed
      structure/unstructure conversion.

   .. method:: __typed_unstructure

      Unstructure an object, adding a '__type__' field
      with the class name.

   .. method:: __typed_structure

      Structure an object, using the '__type__' field to
      determine the class.

   .. note::

      This class is a subclass of cattr.Converter, and extends it with the
      ability to store and retrieve type information for selected class
      hierarchies. This is useful for reconstructing a concrete class from
      unstructured data.

   .. py:method:: register_hierarchy(cls, cls_fn)

      Register a class hierarchy for typed structure/unstructure
      conversion.

      For each class in the hierarchy under (including) ``cls``, this will
      store an additional ``__type__`` attribute (a string) in the object
      dictionary. This ``__type__`` string will be the concrete class of the
      object, and will be used to structure the dictionary back into an
      object of the correct class.

      For this to work, this function needs to know how to convert a
      ``__type__`` string back into a class, for which it used the provided
      ``cls_fn``.

      :param cls: The top-level class of the hierarchy to register.
      :type cls: class
      :param cls_fn: A function mapping type strings to classes. This can be as
                     simple as ``lambda typ: eval(typ)``, if all subclasses of
                     ``cls`` are visible to the module that calls this method.
      :type cls_fn: function

      :raises TypeError: If ``cls`` is not a class.

      .. rubric:: Example

      If class ``A`` is the base of class ``B``, and
      ``converter.register_hierarchy(A, lambda typ: eval(typ))`` has been
      called, the dictionary ``y = converter.unstructure(x)`` will
      contain a ``__type__`` field that is ``'A'`` if ``x = A()`` and
      ``B`` if ``x = B()``.

      This ``__type__`` field is then used by ``x =
      converter.structure(y, A)`` to recreate the concrete type of ``x``.

      .. note::

         This method is used to register a class hierarchy for typed
         structure/unstructure conversion. For each class in the hierarchy
         under (including) ``cls``, this will store an additional
         ``__type__`` attribute (a string) in the object dictionary. This
         ``__type__`` string will be the concrete class of the object, and
         will be used to structure the dictionary back into an object of the
         correct class.
         
         For this to work, this function needs to know how to convert a
         ``__type__`` string back into a class, for which it used the
         provided ``cls_fn``.
