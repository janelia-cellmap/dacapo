.. py:class:: ComputeContext



   Helper class that provides a standard way to create an ABC using
   inheritance.


   .. py:attribute:: distribute_workers
      :type:  Optional[bool]

      The ComputeContext class is an abstract base class for defining the context in which computations are to be done.
      It is inherited from the built-in class `ABC` (Abstract Base Classes). Other classes can inherit this class to define
      their own specific variations of the context. It requires to implement several property methods, and also includes
      additional methods related to the context design.

      .. attribute:: device

         The device on which computations are to be done.

      .. method:: _wrap_command(command)

         Wraps a command in the context specific command.

      .. method:: wrap_command(command)

         Wraps a command in the context specific command and returns it.

      .. method:: execute(command)

         Runs a command in the context specific way.

      .. note:: The class is abstract and requires to implement the abstract methods.


   .. py:property:: device
      :abstractmethod:

      Abstract property method to define the device on which computations are to be done.

      A device can be a CPU, GPU, TPU, etc. It is used to specify the context in which computations are to be done.

      :returns: The device on which computations are to be done.
      :rtype: str

      :raises NotImplementedError: If the method is not implemented in the derived class.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> context = ComputeContext()
      >>> device = context.device

      .. note:: The method should be implemented in the derived class.


   .. py:method:: wrap_command(command)

      A method to wrap a command in the context specific command and return it.

      :param command: The command to be wrapped.
      :type command: List[str]

      :returns: The wrapped command.
      :rtype: List[str]

      :raises NotImplementedError: If the method is not implemented in the derived class.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> context = ComputeContext()
      >>> command = ["python", "script.py"]
      >>> wrapped_command = context.wrap_command(command)

      .. note:: The method should be implemented in the derived class.



   .. py:method:: execute(command)

      A method to run a command in the context specific way.

      :param command: The command to be executed.
      :type command: List[str]

      :raises NotImplementedError: If the method is not implemented in the derived class.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> context = ComputeContext()
      >>> command = ["python", "script.py"]
      >>> context.execute(command)

      .. note:: The method should be implemented in the derived class.



.. py:function:: create_compute_context() -> ComputeContext

   Create a compute context based on the global DaCapo options.

   :returns: The compute context object.
   :rtype: ComputeContext

   :raises ValueError: If the store type is unknown.

   .. rubric:: Examples

   >>> context = create_compute_context()

   .. note:: The method is implemented in the module.
