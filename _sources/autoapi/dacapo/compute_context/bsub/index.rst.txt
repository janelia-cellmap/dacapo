.. py:class:: Bsub



   Helper class that provides a standard way to create an ABC using
   inheritance.


   .. py:attribute:: distribute_workers
      :type:  Optional[bool]

      The Bsub class is a subclass of the ComputeContext class. It is used to specify the
      context in which computations are to be done. Bsub is used to specify that
      computations are to be done on a cluster using LSF.

      .. attribute:: queue

         The queue to run on.

         :type: str

      .. attribute:: num_gpus

         The number of gpus to train on. Currently only 1 gpu can be used.

         :type: int

      .. attribute:: num_cpus

         The number of cpus to use to generate training data.

         :type: int

      .. attribute:: billing

         Project name that will be paying for this Job.

         :type: Optional[str]

      .. method:: device()

         Returns the device on which computations are to be done.

      .. method:: _wrap_command(command)

         Wraps a command in the context specific command.

      .. note:: The class is a subclass of the ComputeContext class.


   .. py:attribute:: queue
      :type:  str


   .. py:attribute:: num_gpus
      :type:  int


   .. py:attribute:: num_cpus
      :type:  int


   .. py:attribute:: billing
      :type:  Optional[str]


   .. py:property:: device
      A property method that returns the device on which computations are to be done.

      A device can be a CPU, GPU, TPU, etc. It is used to specify the context in which computations are to be done.

      :returns: The device on which computations are to be done.
      :rtype: str

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> context = Bsub()
      >>> device = context.device
