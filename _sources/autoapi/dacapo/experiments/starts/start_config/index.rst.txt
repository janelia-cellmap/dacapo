Module Contents

.. py:class:: Start(start_config)



   This class interfaces with the dacapo store to retrieve and load the
   weights of the starter model used for finetuning.

   .. attribute:: run

      str
      The specified run to retrieve weights for the model.

   .. attribute:: criterion

      str
      The policy that was used to decide when to store the weights.

   .. attribute:: channels

      int
      The number of channels in the input data.

   .. method:: __init__(start_config)

      
      Initializes the Start class with specified config to run the
      initialization of weights for a model associated with a specific
      criterion.

   .. method:: initialize_weights(model, new_head=None)

      
      Retrieves the weights from the dacapo store and load them into
      the model.

   .. rubric:: Notes

   This class is used to retrieve and load the weights of the starter
   model used for finetuning from the dacapo store.


   .. py:method:: initialize_weights(model, new_head=None)

      Retrieves the weights from the dacapo store and load them into
      the model.

      :param model: obj
                    The model to which the weights are to be loaded.
      :param new_head: list
                       The labels of the new head.

      :returns:

                obj
                    The model with the weights loaded from the dacapo store.
      :rtype: model

      :raises RuntimeError: If weights of a non-existing or mismatched layer are being
          loaded, a RuntimeError exception is thrown which is logged
          and handled by loading only the common layers from weights.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> model = start.initialize_weights(model, new_head)

      .. rubric:: Notes

      This function is called by the Start class to retrieve the weights
      from the dacapo store and load them into the model.



.. py:class:: StartConfig

   A class to represent the configuration for running tasks. This class
   interfaces with the dacapo store to retrieve and load the weights of the
   starter model used for finetuning.

   .. attribute:: run

      str
      The run to be used as a starting point for tasks.

   .. attribute:: criterion

      str
      The criterion to be used for choosing weights from run.

   .. method:: __init__(start_config)

      
      Initializes the StartConfig class with specified config to run the
      initialization of weights for a model associated with a specific
      criterion.

   .. rubric:: Notes

   This class is used to represent the configuration for running tasks.
