   A U-Net architecture for 3D or 4D data. The U-Net expects 3D or 4D tensors
   shaped like::

       ``(batch=1, channels, [length,] depth, height, width)``.

   This U-Net performs only "valid" convolutions, i.e., sizes of the feature
   maps decrease after each convolution. It will perfrom 4D convolutions as
   long as ``length`` is greater than 1. As soon as ``length`` is 1 due to a
   valid convolution, the time dimension will be dropped and tensors with
