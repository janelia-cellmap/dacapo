.. py:class:: Array



   An Array is a multi-dimensional array of data that can be read from and written to. It is
   defined by a region of interest (ROI) in world units, a voxel size, and a number of spatial
   dimensions. The data is stored in a numpy array, and can be accessed using numpy-like slicing
   syntax.

   The Array class is an abstract base class that defines the interface for all Array
   implementations. It provides a number of properties that must be implemented by subclasses,
   such as the ROI, voxel size, and data type of the array. It also provides a method for fetching
   data from the array, which is implemented by slicing the numpy array.

   The Array class also provides a method for checking if the array can be visualized in
   Neuroglancer, and a method for generating a Neuroglancer layer for the array. These methods are
   implemented by subclasses that support visualization in Neuroglancer.

   .. attribute:: attrs

      A dictionary of metadata attributes stored on this array.

      :type: Dict[str, Any]

   .. attribute:: axes

      The axes of this dataset as a string of characters, as they are indexed.
      Permitted characters are:
          * ``zyx`` for spatial dimensions
          * ``c`` for channels
          * ``s`` for samples

      :type: List[str]

   .. attribute:: dims

      The number of spatial dimensions.

      :type: int

   .. attribute:: voxel_size

      The size of a voxel in physical units.

      :type: Coordinate

   .. attribute:: roi

      The total ROI of this array, in world units.

      :type: Roi

   .. attribute:: dtype

      The dtype of this array, in numpy dtypes

      :type: Any

   .. attribute:: num_channels

      The number of channels provided by this dataset. Should return
      None if the channel dimension doesn't exist.

      :type: Optional[int]

   .. attribute:: data

      A numpy-like readable and writable view into this array.

      :type: np.ndarray

   .. attribute:: writable

      Can we write to this Array?

      :type: bool

   .. method:: __getitem__(self, roi

      Roi) -> np.ndarray: Get a numpy like readable and writable view into
      this array.

   .. method:: _can_neuroglance(self) -> bool

      Check if this array can be visualized in Neuroglancer.

   .. method:: _neuroglancer_layer(self)

      Generate a Neuroglancer layer for this array.

   .. method:: _slices(self, roi

      Roi) -> Iterable[slice]: Generate a list of slices for the given ROI.

   .. note::

      This class is used to define the interface for all Array implementations. It provides a
      number of properties that must be implemented by subclasses, such as the ROI, voxel size, and
      data type of the array. It also provides a method for fetching data from the array, which is
      implemented by slicing the numpy array. The Array class also provides a method for checking
      if the array can be visualized in Neuroglancer, and a method for generating a Neuroglancer
      layer for the array. These methods are implemented by subclasses that support visualization
      in Neuroglancer.
