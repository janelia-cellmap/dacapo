.. py:class:: Array



   An Array is a multi-dimensional array of data that can be read from and written to. It is
   defined by a region of interest (ROI) in world units, a voxel size, and a number of spatial
   dimensions. The data is stored in a numpy array, and can be accessed using numpy-like slicing
   syntax.

   The Array class is an abstract base class that defines the interface for all Array
   implementations. It provides a number of properties that must be implemented by subclasses,
   such as the ROI, voxel size, and data type of the array. It also provides a method for fetching
   data from the array, which is implemented by slicing the numpy array.

   The Array class also provides a method for checking if the array can be visualized in
   Neuroglancer, and a method for generating a Neuroglancer layer for the array. These methods are
   implemented by subclasses that support visualization in Neuroglancer.

      This class is used to define the interface for all Array implementations. It provides a
      number of properties that must be implemented by subclasses, such as the ROI, voxel size, and
      data type of the array. It also provides a method for fetching data from the array, which is
      implemented by slicing the numpy array. The Array class also provides a method for checking
      if the array can be visualized in Neuroglancer, and a method for generating a Neuroglancer
      layer for the array. These methods are implemented by subclasses that support visualization
      in Neuroglancer.
