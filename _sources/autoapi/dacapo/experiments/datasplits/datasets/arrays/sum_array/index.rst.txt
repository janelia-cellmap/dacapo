.. py:class:: SumArray(array_config)



   This class provides a sum array. This array is a virtual array that is created by summing
   multiple source arrays. The source arrays must have the same shape and ROI.

   .. attribute:: name

      str
      The name of the array.

   .. attribute:: _source_arrays

      List[Array]
      The source arrays to sum.

   .. attribute:: _source_array

      Array
      The first source array.

   .. method:: __getitem__(roi

      Roi) -> np.ndarray
      Get the data for the given region of interest.

   .. method:: _can_neuroglance() -> bool

      
      Check if neuroglance can be used.

   .. method:: _neuroglancer_source() -> Dict

      
      Return the source for neuroglance.

   .. method:: _neuroglancer_layer() -> Tuple[neuroglancer.SegmentationLayer, Dict]

      
      Return the neuroglancer layer.

   .. method:: _source_name() -> str

      
      Return the source name.

   .. note:: This class is a subclass of Array.


   .. py:attribute:: name


   .. py:property:: axes
      The axes of the array.

      :returns: The axes of the array.
      :rtype: List[str]

      :raises ValueError: Cannot get a writable view of this array because it is a virtual array created by modifying another array on demand.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> sum_array.axes
      ['x', 'y', 'z']

      .. note:: This class is a subclass of Array.


   .. py:property:: dims
      :type: int

      The number of dimensions of the array.

      :returns: The number of dimensions of the array.
      :rtype: int

      :raises ValueError: Cannot get a writable view of this array because it is a virtual array created by modifying another array on demand.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> sum_array.dims
      3

      .. note:: This class is a subclass of Array.


   .. py:property:: voxel_size
      :type: funlib.geometry.Coordinate

      The size of each voxel in each dimension.

      :returns: The size of each voxel in each dimension.
      :rtype: Coordinate

      :raises ValueError: Cannot get a writable view of this array because it is a virtual array created by modifying another array on demand.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> sum_array.voxel_size
      Coordinate([1, 1, 1])

      .. note:: This class is a subclass of Array.


   .. py:property:: roi
      :type: funlib.geometry.Roi

      The region of interest of the array.

      :param roi: Roi
                  The region of interest.

      :returns: The region of interest.
      :rtype: Roi

      :raises ValueError: Cannot get a writable view of this array because it is a virtual array created by modifying another array on demand.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> sum_array.roi
      Roi(Coordinate([0, 0, 0]), Coordinate([100, 100, 100]))

      .. note:: This class is a subclass of Array.


   .. py:property:: writable
      :type: bool

      Check if the array is writable.

      :param writable: bool
                       Check if the array is writable.

      :returns: True if the array is writable, otherwise False.
      :rtype: bool

      :raises ValueError: Cannot get a writable view of this array because it is a virtual array created by modifying another array on demand.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> sum_array.writable
      False

      .. note:: This class is a subclass of Array.


   .. py:property:: dtype
      The data type of the array.

      :param dtype: np.uint8
                    The data type of the array.

      :returns: The data type of the array.
      :rtype: np.uint8

      :raises ValueError: Cannot get a writable view of this array because it is a virtual array created by modifying another array on demand.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> sum_array.dtype
      np.uint8

      .. note:: This class is a subclass of Array.


   .. py:property:: num_channels
      The number of channels in the array.

      :param num_channels: Optional[int]
                           The number of channels in the array.

      :returns: The number of channels in the array.
      :rtype: Optional[int]

      :raises ValueError: Cannot get a writable view of this array because it is a virtual array created by modifying another array on demand.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> sum_array.num_channels
      None

      .. note:: This class is a subclass of Array.
