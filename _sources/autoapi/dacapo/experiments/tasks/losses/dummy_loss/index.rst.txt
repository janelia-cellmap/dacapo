.. py:class:: DummyLoss



   A class representing a dummy loss function that calculates the absolute difference between each prediction and target.

   Inherits the Loss class.

   .. attribute:: name

      str
      name of the loss function

   .. method:: compute(prediction, target, weight=None)

      
      Calculate the total loss between prediction and target.

   .. note::

      The dummy loss is used to test the training loop and the loss calculation. It is not a real loss function.
      It is used to test the training loop and the loss calculation.


   .. py:method:: compute(prediction, target, weight=None)

      Method to calculate the total dummy loss.

      :param prediction: torch.Tensor
                         the model's prediction
      :param target: torch.Tensor
                     the target values
      :param weight: torch.Tensor
                     the weight to apply to the loss

      :returns:

                torch.Tensor
                    the total loss between prediction and target

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> dummy_loss = DummyLoss()
      >>> prediction = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
      >>> target = torch.tensor([4, 5, 6])
      >>> dummy_loss.compute(prediction, target)
      tensor(9)

      .. note::

         The dummy loss is used to test the training loop and the loss calculation. It is not a real loss function.
