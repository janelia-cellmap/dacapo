.. py:class:: DistanceTaskConfig



   This is a Distance task config used for generating and
   evaluating signed distance transforms as a way of generating
   segmentations.

   The advantage of generating distance transforms over regular
   affinities is you can get a denser signal, i.e. 1 misclassified
   pixel in an affinity prediction could merge 2 otherwise very
   distinct objects, this cannot happen with distances.

   .. attribute:: channels

      A list of channel names.

   .. attribute:: clip_distance

      Maximum distance to consider for false positive/negatives.

   .. attribute:: tol_distance

      Tolerance distance for counting false positives/negatives

   .. attribute:: scale_factor

      The amount by which to scale distances before applying a tanh normalization.

   .. attribute:: mask_distances

      Whether or not to mask out regions where the true distance to
      object boundary cannot be known. This is anywhere that the distance to crop boundary
      is less than the distance to object boundary.

   .. attribute:: clipmin

      The minimum value for distance weights.

   .. attribute:: clipmax

      The maximum value for distance weights.

   .. method:: verify(self) -> Tuple[bool, str]

      This method verifies the DistanceTaskConfig object.

   .. rubric:: Notes

   This is a subclass of TaskConfig.
