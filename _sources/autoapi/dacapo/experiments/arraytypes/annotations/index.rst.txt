.. py:class:: ArrayType



   The type of data provided by an array. The ArrayType class helps to keep
   track of the semantic meaning of an Array. Additionally the ArrayType
   keeps track of metadata that is specific to this datatype such as
   num_classes for an annotated volume or channel names for intensity
   arrays. The ArrayType class is an abstract class and should be subclassed
   to represent different types of arrays.

   .. attribute:: num_classes

      The number of classes in the array.

      :type: int

   .. attribute:: channel_names

      The names of the channels in the array.

      :type: List[str]

   .. method:: interpolatable

      This is an abstract method which should be overridden in each of the subclasses to determine if an array is interpolatable or not.

   .. note:: This class is used to create an ArrayType object which is used to represent the type of data provided by an array.


   .. py:property:: interpolatable
      :type: bool

      :abstractmethod:

      This is an abstract method which should be overridden in each of the subclasses
      to determine if an array is interpolatable or not.

      :returns: True if the array is interpolatable, False otherwise.
      :rtype: bool

      :raises NotImplementedError: This method is not implemented in this class.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> array_type = ArrayType()
      >>> array_type.interpolatable
      NotImplementedError

      .. note:: This method is used to check if the array is interpolatable.


.. py:class:: AnnotationArray



   An AnnotationArray is a uint8, uint16, uint32 or uint64 Array where each
   voxel has a value associated with its class. The class of each voxel can be
   determined by simply taking the value.

   .. attribute:: classes

      A mapping from class label to class name.

      :type: Dict[int, str]

   .. method:: interpolatable(self) -> bool

      It is a method that returns False.

   .. note:: This class is used to create an AnnotationArray object which is used to represent an array of class labels.


   .. py:attribute:: classes
      :type:  Dict[int, str]


   .. py:property:: interpolatable
      Method to return False.

      :returns:

                bool
                    Returns a boolean value of False representing that the values are not interpolatable.

      :raises NotImplementedError: This method is not implemented in this class.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> annotation_array = AnnotationArray(classes={1: "mitochondria", 2: "membrane"})
      >>> annotation_array.interpolatable
      False

      .. note:: This method is used to check if the array is interpolatable.
