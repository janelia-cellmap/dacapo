.. py:class:: ArrayType



   The type of data provided by an array. The ArrayType class helps to keep
   track of the semantic meaning of an Array. Additionally the ArrayType
   keeps track of metadata that is specific to this datatype such as
   num_classes for an annotated volume or channel names for intensity
   arrays. The ArrayType class is an abstract class and should be subclassed
   to represent different types of arrays.

   .. attribute:: num_classes

      The number of classes in the array.

      :type: int

   .. attribute:: channel_names

      The names of the channels in the array.

      :type: List[str]

   .. method:: interpolatable

      This is an abstract method which should be overridden in each of the subclasses to determine if an array is interpolatable or not.

   .. note:: This class is used to create an ArrayType object which is used to represent the type of data provided by an array.


   .. py:property:: interpolatable
      :type: bool

      :abstractmethod:

      This is an abstract method which should be overridden in each of the subclasses
      to determine if an array is interpolatable or not.

      :returns: True if the array is interpolatable, False otherwise.
      :rtype: bool

      :raises NotImplementedError: This method is not implemented in this class.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> array_type = ArrayType()
      >>> array_type.interpolatable
      NotImplementedError

      .. note:: This method is used to check if the array is interpolatable.


.. py:class:: IntensitiesArray



   An IntensitiesArray is an Array of measured intensities. Each voxel has a value in the range [min, max].

   .. attribute:: channels

      A mapping from channel to a name describing that channel.

      :type: Dict[int, str]

   .. attribute:: min

      The minimum possible value of your intensities.

      :type: float

   .. attribute:: max

      The maximum possible value of your intensities.

      :type: float

   .. method:: __attrs_post_init__(self)

      This method is called after the instance has been initialized by the constructor.

   .. method:: interpolatable(self) -> bool

      It is a method that returns True.

   .. note:: This class is used to create an IntensitiesArray object which is used to represent an array of measured intensities.


   .. py:attribute:: channels
      :type:  Dict[int, str]


   .. py:attribute:: min
      :type:  float


   .. py:attribute:: max
      :type:  float


   .. py:property:: interpolatable
      :type: bool

      Method to return True.

      :returns:

                bool
                    Returns a boolean value of True representing that the values are interpolatable.

      :raises NotImplementedError: This method is not implemented in this class.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> intensities_array = IntensitiesArray(channels={1: "channel1"}, min=0, max=1)
      >>> intensities_array.interpolatable
      True

      .. note:: This method is used to check if the array is interpolatable.
