.. py:class:: AnnotationArray




   An AnnotationArray is a uint8, uint16, uint32 or uint64 Array where each
   voxel has a value associated with its class. The class of each voxel can be
   determined by simply taking the value.

      :type: Dict[int, str]

   .. method:: interpolatable(self) -> bool

      It is a method that returns False.

   .. note:: This class is used to create an AnnotationArray object which is used to represent an array of class labels.

   .. py:property:: interpolatable

      Method to return False.

      :returns:

                bool
                    Returns a boolean value of False representing that the values are not interpolatable.

.. py:class:: DistanceArray




   An array containing signed distances to the nearest boundary voxel for a particular label class.
   Distances should be positive outside an object and negative inside an object. The distance should be 0 on the boundary.
   The class of each voxel can be determined by simply taking the argmin. The distance should be in the range [-max, max].
