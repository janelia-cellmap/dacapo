.. py:class:: ProbabilityArray




   Class to represent an array containing probability distributions for each voxel pointed by its coordinate.

   The class defines a ProbabilityArray object with each voxel having a vector of length `c`, where `c` is the
   number of classes. The l1 norm of this vector should always be 1. The class of each voxel can be
   determined by simply taking the argmax.

   .. attribute:: classes

      A mapping from channel to class on which distances were calculated.

      :type: List[str]

   .. py:property:: interpolatable
      :type: bool

      Checks if the array is interpolatable. Returns True for this class.

      :returns: True indicating that the data can be interpolated.
      :rtype: bool
