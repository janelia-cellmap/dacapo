.. py:class:: ProbabilityArray



   Class to represent an array containing probability distributions for each voxel pointed by its coordinate.

   The class defines a ProbabilityArray object with each voxel having a vector of length `c`, where `c` is the
   number of classes. The l1 norm of this vector should always be 1. The class of each voxel can be
   determined by simply taking the argmax.

   .. attribute:: classes

      A mapping from channel to class on which distances were calculated.

      :type: List[str]

   .. note::

      This class is used to create a ProbabilityArray object which is used to represent an array containing probability distributions for each voxel pointed by its coordinate.
      The class of each voxel can be determined by simply taking the argmax.


   .. py:attribute:: classes
      :type:  List[str]


   .. py:property:: interpolatable
      :type: bool


      Checks if the array is interpolatable. Returns True for this class.

      :returns: True indicating that the data can be interpolated.
      :rtype: bool

      :raises NotImplementedError: This method is not implemented in this class

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> probability_array = ProbabilityArray(classes=["class1", "class2"])
      >>> probability_array.interpolatable
      True

      .. note:: This method is used to check if the array is interpolatable.
