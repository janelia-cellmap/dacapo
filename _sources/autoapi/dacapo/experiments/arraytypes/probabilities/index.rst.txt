.. py:class:: ArrayType



   The type of data provided by an array. The ArrayType class helps to keep
   track of the semantic meaning of an Array. Additionally the ArrayType
   keeps track of metadata that is specific to this datatype such as
   num_classes for an annotated volume or channel names for intensity
   arrays. The ArrayType class is an abstract class and should be subclassed
   to represent different types of arrays.

   .. attribute:: num_classes

      The number of classes in the array.

      :type: int

   .. attribute:: channel_names

      The names of the channels in the array.

      :type: List[str]

   .. method:: interpolatable

      This is an abstract method which should be overridden in each of the subclasses to determine if an array is interpolatable or not.

   .. note:: This class is used to create an ArrayType object which is used to represent the type of data provided by an array.


   .. py:property:: interpolatable
      :type: bool

      :abstractmethod:

      This is an abstract method which should be overridden in each of the subclasses
      to determine if an array is interpolatable or not.

      :returns: True if the array is interpolatable, False otherwise.
      :rtype: bool

      :raises NotImplementedError: This method is not implemented in this class.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> array_type = ArrayType()
      >>> array_type.interpolatable
      NotImplementedError

      .. note:: This method is used to check if the array is interpolatable.


.. py:class:: ProbabilityArray



   Class to represent an array containing probability distributions for each voxel pointed by its coordinate.

   The class defines a ProbabilityArray object with each voxel having a vector of length `c`, where `c` is the
   number of classes. The l1 norm of this vector should always be 1. The class of each voxel can be
   determined by simply taking the argmax.

   .. attribute:: classes

      A mapping from channel to class on which distances were calculated.

      :type: List[str]

   .. note::

      This class is used to create a ProbabilityArray object which is used to represent an array containing probability distributions for each voxel pointed by its coordinate.
      The class of each voxel can be determined by simply taking the argmax.


   .. py:attribute:: classes
      :type:  List[str]


   .. py:property:: interpolatable
      :type: bool

      Checks if the array is interpolatable. Returns True for this class.

      :returns: True indicating that the data can be interpolated.
      :rtype: bool

      :raises NotImplementedError: This method is not implemented in this class

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> probability_array = ProbabilityArray(classes=["class1", "class2"])
      >>> probability_array.interpolatable
      True

      .. note:: This method is used to check if the array is interpolatable.
