.. py:class:: DistanceArray



   An array containing signed distances to the nearest boundary voxel for a particular label class.
   Distances should be positive outside an object and negative inside an object. The distance should be 0 on the boundary.
   The class of each voxel can be determined by simply taking the argmin. The distance should be in the range [-max, max].

   .. attribute:: classes

      A mapping from channel to class on which distances were calculated.

      :type: Dict[int, str]

   .. attribute:: max

      The maximum possible distance value of your distances.

      :type: float

   .. method:: interpolatable(self) -> bool

      It is a method that returns True.

   .. note::

      This class is used to create a DistanceArray object which is used to represent an array containing signed distances to the nearest boundary voxel for a particular label class.
      The class of each voxel can be determined by simply taking the argmin.


   .. py:attribute:: classes
      :type:  Dict[int, str]


   .. py:property:: interpolatable
      :type: bool

      Checks if the array is interpolatable. Returns True for this class.

      :returns: True indicating that the data can be interpolated.
      :rtype: bool

      :raises NotImplementedError: This method is not implemented in this class

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> distance_array = DistanceArray(classes={1: "class1"})
      >>> distance_array.interpolatable
      True

      .. note:: This method is used to check if the array is interpolatable.
