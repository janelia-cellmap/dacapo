   .. py:method:: subscores(iteration_scores: List[dacapo.experiments.validation_iteration_scores.ValidationIterationScores]) -> ValidationScores

      Create a new ValidationScores object with a subset of the iteration scores.

      :param iteration_scores: The iteration scores to include in the new ValidationScores object.

      :returns: A new ValidationScores object with the specified iteration scores.

      :raises ValueError: If the iteration scores are not in the list of scores.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> validation_scores.subscores([validation_scores.scores[0]])

      .. note::

         This method is used to create a new ValidationScores object with a subset of the
         iteration scores. This is useful when you want to create a new ValidationScores object
         that only contains the scores up to a certain iteration.


   .. py:method:: add_iteration_scores(iteration_scores: dacapo.experiments.validation_iteration_scores.ValidationIterationScores) -> None

      Add iteration scores to the list of scores.

      :param iteration_scores: The iteration scores to add.

      :raises ValueError: If the iteration scores are already in the list of scores.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> validation_scores.add_iteration_scores(validation_scores.scores[0])

      .. note::

         This method is used to add iteration scores to the list of scores. This is useful when
         you want to add scores for a new iteration to the ValidationScores object.


   .. py:method:: delete_after(iteration: int) -> None

      Delete scores after a specified iteration.

      :param iteration: The iteration after which to delete the scores.

      :raises ValueError: If the iteration scores are not in the list of scores.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> validation_scores.delete_after(0)

      .. note::

         This method is used to delete scores after a specified iteration. This is useful when
         you want to delete scores after a certain iteration.


   .. py:method:: validated_until() -> int

      Get the number of iterations validated for (the maximum iteration plus one).

      :returns: The number of iterations validated for.

      :raises ValueError: If there are no scores.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> validation_scores.validated_until()

      .. note::

         This method is used to get the number of iterations validated for (the maximum iteration
         plus one). This is useful when you want to know how many iterations have been validated.


   .. py:method:: compare(existing_iteration_scores: List[dacapo.experiments.validation_iteration_scores.ValidationIterationScores]) -> Tuple[bool, int]

      Compare iteration stats provided from elsewhere to scores we have saved locally.
      Local scores take priority. If local scores are at a lower iteration than the
      existing ones, delete the existing ones and replace with local.
      If local iteration > existing iteration, just update existing scores with the last
      overhanging local scores.

      :param existing_iteration_scores: The existing iteration scores to compare with.

      :returns: A tuple indicating whether the local scores should replace the existing ones
                and the existing iteration number.

      :raises ValueError: If the iteration scores are not in the list of scores.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> validation_scores.compare([validation_scores.scores[0]])

      .. note::

         This method is used to compare iteration stats provided from elsewhere to scores we have
         saved locally. Local scores take priority. If local scores are at a lower iteration than
         the existing ones, delete the existing ones and replace with local. If local iteration >
         existing iteration, just update existing scores with the last overhanging local scores.


   .. py:method:: to_xarray() -> xarray.DataArray

      Convert the validation scores to an xarray DataArray.

      :returns: An xarray DataArray representing the validation scores.

      :raises ValueError: If there are no scores.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> validation_scores.to_xarray()

      .. note::

         This method is used to convert the validation scores to an xarray DataArray. This is
         useful when you want to work with the validation scores as an xarray DataArray.


   .. py:method:: get_best(data: xarray.DataArray, dim: str) -> Tuple[xarray.DataArray, xarray.DataArray]

      Compute the Best scores along dimension "dim" per criterion.
      Returns both the index associated with the best value, and the
      best value in two separate arrays.

      :param data: The data array to compute the best scores from.
      :param dim: The dimension along which to compute the best scores.

      :returns: A tuple containing the index associated with the best value and the best value
                in two separate arrays.

      :raises ValueError: If the criteria are not in the data array.

      .. rubric:: Examples

      >>> validation_scores.get_best(data, "iterations")

      .. note::

         This method is used to compute the Best scores along dimension "dim" per criterion. It
         returns both the index associated with the best value and the best value in two separate
         arrays. This is useful when you want to know the best scores for a given data array.
         Fix: The method is currently not able to handle the case where the criteria are not in the data array.
         To fix this, we need to add a check to see if the criteria are in the data array and raise an error if they are not.
